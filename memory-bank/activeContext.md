# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The VR Tour platform has achieved a **major milestone** with completion of the content creation system (TourEditor) and resolution of critical coordinate system issues. The platform now offers both full viewing experience and content management capabilities.

## Recent Critical Fixes ✅

### 🐛 **MAJOR BUG RESOLUTION: Hotspot Movement Issue**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Hotspots now remain stable during scene transitions and camera movements

**Problem**: Hotspots were visually "moving" when switching between scenes in editor mode and during camera angle changes, despite having unchanged coordinates (yaw/pitch values remained the same but visual position shifted).

**Root Causes Identified & Fixed**:

1. **VRScene Remounting Issue** ✅ FIXED
   - VRScene was remounting on scene changes due to `key={scene-${activeSceneId}}`
   - This reset camera state and caused coordinate system confusion
   - **Solution**: Removed scene ID from VRScene key prop to prevent unnecessary remounting

2. **Performance Issues in useFrame** ✅ FIXED
   - Hotspot component had excessive `lookAt` calls (60fps) in useFrame
   - Console spam from debug logs was causing performance issues
   - **Solution**: Added throttling for billboard lookAt calls and removed debug console logs

3. **Camera Controller Issues** ✅ FIXED
   - Camera lerping during scene transitions caused coordinate system confusion
   - Instant positioning needed for significant camera changes (>10 degrees)
   - **Solution**: Added scene change detection with immediate camera positioning

4. **Position Caching Bugs** ✅ FIXED
   - Faulty position caching logic in Hotspot component with yaw/pitch-based keys
   - Unnecessary position copying in useFrame causing instability
   - **Solution**: Removed caching logic, hotspots now use position prop directly

### 🎯 **Coordinate System Unification Complete** ✅
- ✅ Unified coordinate system across all VR components 
- ✅ Shared raycasting utility (`utils/coordinateSystem.ts`) for consistent calculations
- ✅ Fixed coordinate mismatch between click and drop events (was ~86° yaw difference)
- ✅ All interaction types now use identical coordinate conversion logic

## Current Implementation Status

### 🚀 **Performance Optimizations Applied**

1. **VR Scene Performance**
   - ✅ Throttled camera updates (16ms during interaction, 100ms idle)
   - ✅ Memoized hotspot positions to prevent recalculation
   - ✅ Optimized Three.js texture loading and cleanup
   - ✅ Billboard effect optimization with position-based caching

2. **Editor Performance**
