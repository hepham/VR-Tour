# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Setting up and completing the VR Tour platform implementation. The backend is fully implemented, but the frontend needs development to create a working application.

## Recent Changes
- Complete Django backend implementation with models, serializers, views, admin
- Basic React frontend structure with TypeScript configuration
- Project dependencies configured for both backend and frontend

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Development Priority
The main gap is in the React frontend implementation. Need to complete:
- **VRScene Component**: Three.js 360° panoramic rendering
- **TourList Component**: Browse and select tours interface  
- **TourViewer Component**: Main VR experience with controls
- **API Integration**: Connect frontend to Django backend

### 2. Component Implementation Order
1. **TourList**: Tour browsing and selection (simpler, no 3D)
2. **API Service**: Backend communication layer
3. **VRScene**: Core 360° rendering with Three.js
4. **TourViewer**: Integration of VR scene with controls
5. **Testing & Polish**: Cross-browser testing and UX refinements

### 3. Technical Priorities
- Install frontend dependencies (`npm install`)
- Set up development servers (Django + Vite)
- Implement Three.js panoramic sphere rendering
- Add hotspot interaction and scene navigation
- Style components for responsive design

## Active Decisions

### Frontend State Management
- **Decision**: Use React Context + useState (no Redux needed)
- **Rationale**: Simple state requirements, avoid overengineering

### 3D Library Choice
- **Decision**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Rationale**: Mature ecosystem, good React integration, performance

### Development Workflow
- **Decision**: Parallel development setup (Django backend + Vite frontend)
- **Rationale**: Independent development, API-first approach

## Current Blockers
- **None identified** - clear path forward with frontend development

## Testing Strategy
- Backend: Django test framework for models and API endpoints
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component testing
- Integration: Manual testing of complete user flows
- Performance: Three.js rendering performance validation

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete TourList component implementation
2. Establish API communication between frontend and backend
3. Begin VRScene component with basic 360° panoramic rendering
4. Set up development environment for testing
